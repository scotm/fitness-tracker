# Project Status Report - February 2025

## 1. TRPC Migration Status

### Completed âœ…
- Basic TRPC infrastructure setup
  - Server setup (src/server/trpc.ts)
  - Client setup (src/lib/trpc.ts)
  - API route configuration (src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts)
- Initial router implementation
  - Base router (_app.ts)
  - Exercise router (exercise.ts)
- Integration with existing validation schemas

### In Progress ðŸš§
- Migration of REST endpoints to TRPC procedures
- Client-side hook updates to use TRPC
- Error handling implementation
- Testing setup

### Recommendations
1. Complete proof of concept with exercise endpoints first
2. Add comprehensive error handling in TRPC routers
3. Implement integration tests before full migration
4. Document new patterns for team reference

## 2. Exercise Library Status

### Completed âœ…
- Component structure
  - ExerciseList
  - ExerciseCard
  - ExerciseDetail
  - ExerciseFilters
  - ExerciseForm
- Database schema implementation
- Validation schemas
- Basic routing setup

### In Progress ðŸš§
- Core list view implementation
- Filter functionality
- Exercise management features
- Image/video support
- Testing implementation

### Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. Complete core list view
   - Basic grid layout
   - Loading states
   - Error handling
2. Implement filtering system
   - Filter components
   - Search functionality
   - URL state synchronization
3. Add exercise management
   - Create/edit forms
   - Validation
   - Image upload
4. Develop detail view
   - Modal/page implementation
   - Exercise statistics
   - Related exercises

## 3. Overall Project Status

### Strengths
- Well-documented implementation plans
- Clear architecture decisions
- Strong type safety with TypeScript and Zod
- Comprehensive component structure

### Areas for Improvement
1. Testing Coverage
   - Need integration tests for TRPC endpoints
   - Component unit tests required
   - E2E tests for critical flows

2. Documentation
   - Add inline documentation for TRPC procedures
   - Create usage examples for new patterns
   - Document testing strategies

3. Error Handling
   - Implement consistent error handling patterns
   - Add error boundaries
   - Improve error messages

## 4. Immediate Action Items

1. TRPC Migration
   ```typescript
   // Priority tasks:
   - Complete exercise router implementation
   - Add error handling middleware
   - Create integration tests
   - Update client hooks
   ```

2. Exercise Library
   ```typescript
   // Priority tasks:
   - Finish core list view
   - Implement filter system
   - Add exercise management
   - Create detail view
   ```

3. Testing
   ```typescript
   // Priority tasks:
   - Set up testing infrastructure
   - Write TRPC integration tests
   - Add component unit tests
   - Implement E2E tests
   ```

## 5. Timeline

### Week 1
- Complete TRPC proof of concept
- Finish core exercise list view
- Implement basic filtering

### Week 2
- Migrate remaining endpoints to TRPC
- Add exercise management features
- Implement detail view

### Week 3
- Complete testing implementation
- Add documentation
- Polish and bug fixes

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- TRPC migration (parallel implementation)
- Component development (isolated)
- Testing implementation (can be done in parallel)

### Medium Risk
- Data migration
- Performance optimization
- Integration points

### High Risk
- None identified currently

## 7. Success Metrics

- All REST endpoints migrated to TRPC
- Exercise library feature complete
- Test coverage > 80%
- Type safety across all features
- Improved developer experience
- Performance metrics within targets

## 8. Next Review

Schedule technical review after TRPC proof of concept completion to validate:
- Type safety improvements
- Developer experience
- Performance impact
- Migration strategy effectiveness
