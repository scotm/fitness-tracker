# Exercise Library Implementation Plan

## 1. Data Layer

### API Routes
```typescript
// /api/exercises
GET    /api/exercises          // List exercises with filtering
POST   /api/exercises          // Create new exercise
GET    /api/exercises/:id      // Get exercise details
PUT    /api/exercises/:id      // Update exercise
DELETE /api/exercises/:id      // Delete exercise
```

### Database Operations
```typescript
// Core queries needed:
- List exercises with filters
- Get single exercise by ID
- Create new exercise
- Update existing exercise
- Delete exercise
- Get exercises by category/muscle group
```

## 2. Components

### ExerciseList
```typescript
// Main list view with filtering
interface ExerciseListProps {
  filters: {
    category?: string;
    difficulty?: string;
    targetMuscle?: string;
    search?: string;
  };
  onExerciseSelect: (exercise: Exercise) => void;
}
```

### ExerciseCard
```typescript
// Individual exercise display
interface ExerciseCardProps {
  exercise: Exercise;
  onSelect: () => void;
  onEdit?: () => void;
  onDelete?: () => void;
}
```

### ExerciseFilters
```typescript
// Filter controls
interface ExerciseFiltersProps {
  categories: string[];
  difficulties: string[];
  muscles: string[];
  onFilterChange: (filters: Filters) => void;
}
```

### ExerciseForm
```typescript
// Create/Edit form
interface ExerciseFormProps {
  exercise?: Exercise;
  onSubmit: (data: NewExercise) => Promise<void>;
  onCancel: () => void;
}
```

### ExerciseDetail
```typescript
// Modal/Page for detailed view
interface ExerciseDetailProps {
  exercise: Exercise;
  onClose: () => void;
  onEdit?: () => void;
}
```

## 3. State Management

### React Query Setup
```typescript
// Key queries
const exerciseKeys = {
  all: ['exercises'] as const,
  lists: () => [...exerciseKeys.all, 'list'] as const,
  list: (filters: Filters) => [...exerciseKeys.lists(), filters] as const,
  details: () => [...exerciseKeys.all, 'detail'] as const,
  detail: (id: string) => [...exerciseKeys.details(), id] as const,
}

// Query hooks
useExercises(filters: Filters)
useExercise(id: string)
```

## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core List View
1. Create basic list component
2. Implement exercise card
3. Add basic grid layout
4. Connect to API
5. Add loading states

### Phase 2: Filtering & Search
1. Create filter components
2. Implement search functionality
3. Add filter state management
4. Update API integration
5. Add URL state sync

### Phase 3: Exercise Management
1. Create exercise form
2. Add create/edit modal
3. Implement validation
4. Add image upload
5. Implement optimistic updates

### Phase 4: Detail View
1. Create detail modal/page
2. Add exercise statistics
3. Implement related exercises
4. Add exercise history
5. Implement sharing

## 5. UI/UX Considerations

### Layout
- Responsive grid layout
- Card-based design
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent spacing

### Interactions
- Smooth transitions
- Loading skeletons
- Error states
- Success feedback

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation
- ARIA labels
- Focus management
- Color contrast

## 6. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Filter logic
- Component rendering
- Form validation
- State management

### Integration Tests
- API integration
- Filter combinations
- CRUD operations
- Error handling

### E2E Tests
- Exercise creation flow
- Search and filter
- Edit exercise
- Delete exercise

## 7. Next Steps

1. Begin with API route implementation
2. Create basic list and card components
3. Implement core database queries
4. Add basic filtering
5. Create exercise form

Ready to switch to Code mode to begin implementation of the Exercise Library feature.
