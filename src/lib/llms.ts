Example 1:

Lift yourself up off the ground by pressing down on the bars and extend your arms fully. Your legs should be hanging straight down and your body shouldn't be touching the bars.\n\n3. Keep your core engaged and your body upright. Lean slightly forward to emphasize activation in the chest muscles. Keep your elbows close to your body.\n\n4. Slowly lower your body by bending your elbows. Keep your elbows tucked in close to your sides as you lower yourself. Lower until your elbows are at about a 90-degree angle or slightly below. Feel the stretch in your chest and triceps.\n\n5. Pause briefly at the bottom of the movement.\n\n6. Push yourself back up to the starting position by straightening your arms. Ensure your movements are controlled, focusing on using your chest and triceps to lift.\n\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, keeping your core tight and your movements controlled throughout the exercise.",

Align your shoulders directly over your wrists.\n2. Engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine, ensuring that your hips do not sag or pike upwards throughout the movement.\n3. Lift your right foot off the ground and drive your right knee towards your chest, keeping your left foot stationary.\n4. Quickly switch legs, placing your right foot back on the ground as you simultaneously lift your left foot and drive your left knee towards your chest.\n5. Continue alternating legs at a fast pace while maintaining the plank position, ensuring your abs stay engaged and your back remains flat throughout the exercise.\n6.
